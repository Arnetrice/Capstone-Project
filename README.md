# Loan Default Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for my capstone project in applied data science. The project focuses on predicting loan default risk using machine learning techniques.

## Project Description
In this capstone project, I address the challenge of predicting whether a loan applicant is likely to default on their loan. I leverage a dataset of historical loan data and employ various classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression and Decision Trees, to build a predictive model.

## Installation Instructions
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Install Python 3.x.
2. Install Anaconda Navigator.
3. Clone this repository.
4. Install required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage
To train the model and make predictions, run the `Loan_Default_Prediction_Full_Code-ArnetriceSmith.ipynb` notebook.

## Data Sources
The dataset used in this project can be found at [hmeq.csv](https://github.com/Arnetrice/Loan-Default-Prediction-Capstone/blob/main/hmeq.csv).

## Results
The predictive model achieved an accuracy of 0.89 and identified a 3% improvement in positive return.
